<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a standing sound wave simulator in both open and close ends. It has two modes called static and dynamic. In static mode we can find the
amplitude at any point by just hovering over it. In dynamic mode we can view how the standing wave behaves in reality. For measuring amplitude in static
mode we need to align the dotted line with the centre of the tube and that is instructed in the project too. Both open and closed end tubes as well as
displacement and pressure waves can be visualised here.

<!-- BUILT USING -->
## Built using

This project has been built using html, css and vanilla javascript. Html Canvas helped in the on-hover animation and also the dynamic view.
